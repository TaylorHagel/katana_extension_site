**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Read all warnings before using this feature!**

#### Step 1: Update Supplier Email Information

1. **Go to Contacts ‚Üí Suppliers** in Katana

   - Click "Download Supplier Data" to get the edit file
   - Open the Excel file and find the supplier you want to update
   - In the "Email" column, enter multiple email addresses separated by ", " (comma and space)

2. **Click the Email button** as you normally would
3. **The tool automatically:**
   - Detects if the supplier has multiple emails configured
   - Processes any email validation errors
   - Extracts and enters all email addresses individually
   - Handles the email sending process seamlessly

**What you'll see:** The email dialog will populate with all configured email addresses as separate entries.

### Important Warnings and Limitations

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warnings

**QuickBooks Online Integration Issues:**
- Multiple emails **WILL cause QBO sync problems**
- Email is the primary field used to match suppliers between Katana and QBO
- Suppliers with multiple emails may not sync properly

**Supplier Management Limitations:**
- Suppliers with multiple emails will show **validation errors** on their supplier cards
- **In-app supplier editing will not work** for these suppliers
- All future updates must be done through the **Admin Panel** or the Supplier Edit Tool
- The supplier card will display as having data errors

**Technical Considerations:**
- This tool bypasses Katana's standard email validation
- Multiple emails are not officially supported by Katana
- Use only when the benefits outweigh the integration risks

#### ‚úÖ Best Practices

1. **Test first:** Try with one non-critical supplier before widespread use
2. **Document changes:** Keep a record of which suppliers have multiple emails
3. **QBO users:** Consider if email-based supplier sync is critical for your workflow
4. **Backup plan:** Ensure you can manage supplier updates through Admin Panel

#### üîß Technical Details

- **Email limit:** Maximum 3 email addresses per supplier
- **Format requirement:** Must be separated by ", " (comma and space)
- **Automatic activation:** No setup required - works on all purchase order pages
- **Error handling:** Gracefully processes validation errors and extracts valid emails

## Historical Sales Orders Import

### Setting Up Historical Imports

**What this does:** Import historical sales orders from Shopify or other systems to establish proper inventory levels and sales history in Katana.

2. **Select the location** where stock adjustments should be applied
3. **Location is required** for historical imports

### Using Shopify Exports

**When to use:** You have Shopify order export files and want to import historical sales data.

#### Preparing Shopify Export

1. **Export from Shopify:**
   - Go to Orders in your Shopify admin
   - Export orders with "All columns" selected
   - **Optional:** Add "Cost Per Item" column for accurate inventory costing

2. **Important Column:** The tool uses "Lineitem fulfillment status" (Column X)
   - **Only "fulfilled" orders are imported**
   - **"unfulfilled" orders are completely skipped**
   - This ensures inventory accuracy

#### Importing Shopify Data

1. **Download template first** (optional, for reference)
2. **Select your Shopify CSV file**
3. **Enter Shopify store name** (optional, for order tracking)
4. **Click "Import Historical Sales Orders"**
5. **Monitor progress** - the tool will:
   - Filter to only fulfilled orders
   - Create stock adjustments for inventory
   - Create customers (if needed)
   - Create sales orders
   - Create fulfillments

### Using Template Format

**When to use:** You have historical order data in a custom format or want to create test data.

#### Template Fields

Download the template to see required columns:
- `sku` - Product SKU (required)
- `qty` - Quantity sold (required)
- `unit_price` - Sale price per unit
- `unit_cost` - Cost per unit (optional, for inventory costing)
- `currency` - Order currency (defaults to USD)
- `customer_email` - Customer email
- `billing_name` - Customer name
- `shipping_name` - Shipping contact name
- Address fields (shipping_address_line1, city, state, zip, country)

#### Template Import Process

1. **Download the template**
2. **Fill in your historical order data**
   - One line item per row
   - Multiple rows can have the same order if needed
3. **All template orders are treated as "fulfilled"**
4. **Import the completed file**

### Understanding the Import Process

#### What Gets Created

**For each import, the tool creates:**

1. **Stock Adjustment:**
   - Adds inventory quantities to match historical sales
   - Uses average cost per unit if multiple costs provided
   - Date set to 1 day before oldest order
   - **Goal:** Balance inventory (Stock Added = Stock Sold)

2. **Customers:**
   - Creates customers that don't already exist
   - Matches by email first, then by name
   - Creates "Unknown Shopify Customer" if no contact info

3. **Sales Orders:**
   - Creates historical sales orders with proper dates
   - Links to created/matched customers
   - Includes shipping addresses when available

4. **Fulfillments:**
   - Creates fulfillments for orders with fulfillment dates
   - Marks orders as completed in Katana

#### Filtering Logic

**Shopify Files:**
- **Fulfilled orders only** - unfulfilled orders are skipped entirely
- Uses "Lineitem fulfillment status" column for accurate filtering
- Provides detailed filtering summary in results

**Template Files:**
- **All orders processed** - no status filtering applied
- Assumes all template data represents completed sales

#### Results and Logging

- **Detailed progress tracking** with real-time updates
- **Comprehensive results** showing counts of created items
- **Error handling** with specific error messages
- **Download results log** for detailed per-row status
- **History integration** for session tracking

#### Cost Handling

- **With costs:** Average cost per SKU used for stock adjustment
- **Without costs:** Stock adjustment created with $0.00 cost
- **Shopify "Cost Per Item" column is optional** but recommended

   - Products page
   - Materials page 
   - Inventory page

2. **Click the export button** for your data type
