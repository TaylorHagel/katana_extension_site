## Multiple Email Tool

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Read all warnings before using this feature!**

#### Step 1: Update Supplier Email Information

1. **Go to Contacts ‚Üí Suppliers** in Katana
2. **Use the Supplier Edit Tool:**
   - Click "Download Supplier Data" to get the edit file
   - Open the Excel file and find the supplier you want to update
   - In the "Email" column, enter multiple email addresses separated by ", " (comma and space)
   - **Format example:** `primary@supplier.com, accounting@supplier.com, orders@supplier.com`
   - **Maximum:** 3 email addresses per supplier
3. **Re-import the file:**
   - Click "Import Suppliers" and select your edited file
   - The extension will update the supplier with multiple emails

### Using the Multiple Email Feature

**How it works:** The tool runs automatically in the background - no manual activation needed.

1. **Go to any Purchase Order page** (the tool activates automatically)
2. **Click the Email button** as you normally would
3. **The tool automatically:**
   - Detects if the supplier has multiple emails configured
   - Processes any email validation errors
   - Extracts and enters all email addresses individually
   - Handles the email sending process seamlessly

**What you'll see:** The email dialog will populate with all configured email addresses as separate entries.

### Important Warnings and Limitations

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warnings

**QuickBooks Online Integration Issues:**
- Multiple emails **WILL cause QBO sync problems**
- Email is the primary field used to match suppliers between Katana and QBO
- Suppliers with multiple emails may not sync properly

**Supplier Management Limitations:**
- Suppliers with multiple emails will show **validation errors** on their supplier cards
- **In-app supplier editing will not work** for these suppliers
- All future updates must be done through the **Admin Panel** or the Supplier Edit Tool
- The supplier card will display as having data errors

**Technical Considerations:**
- This tool bypasses Katana's standard email validation
- Multiple emails are not officially supported by Katana
- Use only when the benefits outweigh the integration risks

#### ‚úÖ Best Practices

1. **Test first:** Try with one non-critical supplier before widespread use
2. **Document changes:** Keep a record of which suppliers have multiple emails
3. **QBO users:** Consider if email-based supplier sync is critical for your workflow
4. **Backup plan:** Ensure you can manage supplier updates through Admin Panel

#### üîß Technical Details

- **Email limit:** Maximum 3 email addresses per supplier
- **Format requirement:** Must be separated by ", " (comma and space)
- **Automatic activation:** No setup required - works on all purchase order pages
- **Error handling:** Gracefully processes validation errors and extracts valid emails

## Data Export Tools

### Exporting Custom Field Data

**When to use:** Get, add or edit product, material, or inventory data with custom field values.

1. **Go to the relevant page:**
   - Products page
   - Materials page 
   - Inventory page

2. **Click the export button** for your data type
3. **Wait for processing** - larger datasets take longer
4. **Download Excel file** with all data and custom field values
